# Brain2Word Model

## Introduction
The "Brain2Word" project explores the field of decoding brain activity to generate language. The project combines brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and natural language processing (NLP) methods to generate coherent and meaningful language output directly from neural signals. The codebase contans the implementation of the architecture of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) as mentioned in the paper along with additional capacity to test impact of different word embeddings on the results. 

## Prerequisites
Before using this codebase, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Code Structure
The codebase is organized as follows:

- `Data/`: Contains the dataset files used in the experiments.
- `Models/`: Contains the implementation of the Brain2Word model architecture.
- `Training/`: Contains the files used to train each of the models.
- `evaluation_metrics`: Provides evaluation metrics and utilities for model performance assessment.
